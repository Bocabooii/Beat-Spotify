# Beat-Spotify

## Description
The purpose of this project was to use everything we have learned in the past 6 modules to create a font-end application. The application is a lighthearted game designed to use two server-side APIs that provides the album images for a user and also uses another API to search for song lyrics. The goal of the game is to guess as many songs correct in a row, and your score will be logged in a local highscore table.

## User Story
```
AS Someone who enjoys trivia games and music
I WANT a game that tests my knowledge of popular songs
SO THAT when given lyrics of a song, I can guess which album it belongs to
```
